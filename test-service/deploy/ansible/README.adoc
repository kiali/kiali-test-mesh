Ansible installer for Kiali Test Mesh

A straightforward instalation command is

[source,shell]
----
ansible-playbook deploy_test_meshes.yml -e number_of_services=6 -e number_of_versions=1 -e number_of_apps=6 -e deployment_type='Deployment' -e '{"meshes": ["kiali-test-depth", "kiali-test-breadth", "kiali-test-circle", "kiali-test-circle-callback", "kiali-test-hourglass", "kiali-test-depth-sink", "kiali-test-breadth-sink"]}' -v
----
which

- `number_of_services` is the number of services will be deployed per namespace

- `number_of_versions` is the number of versions each service will have per namespace

- `meshes` specifies which mesh will be installed.

- `number_of_apps` is the number of apps each workload will match. The playbook will distribute equally through the services

- `deployment_type` is the type of Deployment on Openshift (it can be ReplicaSet or Deployment - deployment will be use in case this variable is not defined)


== Available Meshes

== Kiali Complex Test Mesh
This mesh crosses multiple namespaces, uses deployments and replicatsets, and includes both workloads and applications. It is meant to be used to see how Kiali handles more complex scenarios.
